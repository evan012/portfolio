                <h2>Scratch Project</h2>
                <h3>August 31, 2017 - September 8, 2017</h3>
                <p id="desc"> In this project, I was asked to develop a fully functional and interactive game using Scratch. I was handed a set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="_blank">instructions</a>                    and criteria that I had to follow. The project took place during the 31st of August, 2017, to 8th of September, 2017, and it was done with a partner. My goal was to create a interactive and fun scratch game, and also a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UCWvWLehBU8cQMT2yfziysyLNIoTctJ7jhvvB4jqpc/edit"
                        target="_blank">notebook</a> that records each day's progress and accomplishments, as well as our brainstorm process. The notebook was created following this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doS3G6X6MGMMkthUN7bSNIoScW8kCv2AMAJN_sctYKc/edit"
                        target="_blank">format</a>. There were four main steps that transpired during this project: Brainstorming ideas, choosing the best idea, code the first version, and fix all bugs and add onto the game for the final version. Out of the
                    four focal parts of the project, I believe that brainstorming ideas for the puzzle cube influenced my areas of interest and thinking of certain areas. I wanted to create a unique and one of a kind game, so I continued thinking of ideas
                    that would make my game both fun, and original. From this experience and on, my solution enabled me to take pride into my work, and confirmed that hard work always has a result. When we were done brainstorming ideas and thinking of
                    ways to make the game fun, I started coding, while my partner worked on the project. Each day's progress was successful, and we cooperated well. The project went smoothly. During the gallery walk, where we present our scratch projects
                    with other groups in the classroom, we got lots of feedback on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UCWvWLehBU8cQMT2yfziysyLNIoTctJ7jhvvB4jqpc/edit" target="_blank">notebook</a> that said that our game concept was fun,
                    and the game was easy to control.
