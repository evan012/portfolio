                <h2>Scratch Project</h2>
                <h3>August 31, 2017 - September 8, 2017</h3>
                <p id="desc"> In this project, I was asked to develop a fully functional and interactive game using Scratch. I was handed a set of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="_blank">instructions</a>                    and criteria that I had to follow. The project took place during the 31st of August, 2017, to 8th of September, 2017, and it was done with a partner. My goal was to create a interactive and fun scratch game, and also a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UCWvWLehBU8cQMT2yfziysyLNIoTctJ7jhvvB4jqpc/edit"
                        target="_blank">notebook</a> that records each day's progress and accomplishments, as well as our brainstorm process. The notebook was created following this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doS3G6X6MGMMkthUN7bSNIoScW8kCv2AMAJN_sctYKc/edit"
                        target="_blank">format</a>. There were four main steps that transpired during this project: Brainstorming ideas, choosing the best idea, code the first version, and fix all bugs and add onto the game for the final version. Out of the
                    four focal parts of the project, I believe that brainstorming ideas for the puzzle cube influenced my areas of interest and thinking of certain areas. I wanted to create a unique and one of a kind game, so I continued thinking of ideas
                    that would make my game both fun, and original. From this experience and on, my solution enabled me to take pride into my work, and confirmed that hard work always has a result. When we were done brainstorming ideas and thinking of
                    ways to make the game fun, I started coding, while my partner worked on the project. Each day's progress was successful, and we cooperated well. The project went smoothly. During the gallery walk, where we present our scratch projects
                    with other groups in the classroom, we got lots of feedback on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UCWvWLehBU8cQMT2yfziysyLNIoTctJ7jhvvB4jqpc/edit" target="_blank">notebook</a> that said that our game concept was fun,
                    and the game was easy to control.

                <h2>App Inventor Project</h2>
                <h3>September 25, 2017 - October 6, 2017</h3>
                <p id="desc"> This was a project that enabled me to both test my knowledge on coding as well as creativity. The project was completed with a partner. Our goal was to develop a fun and unique mobile game using App Inventor. To do so, I was handed a set of  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp9_swt29piCMyCC8rl4iVvOa2mhee1q0ZmHlknJ0ok/edit" target="_blank">procedures</a> to follow. We began our project first by obtaining all necessary files/code for the game, and brainstorming ideas on what features could be added onto the game to make it more interesting. Here is
                a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HglAKiDUOw0eHpPP9G3Z22du5IvO68Om9Vg8zlxj6s8/edit" target="_blank">document</a> that contains our brainstorm process, ideas, daily log throughout the project, as well as feedback from others. We eventually developed the game idea - a two player pirate ship game, and to win, the players must collect more coins than the other player before the time runs out. Brainstorming was only the first step of a long way ahead - and the next essential step was coding the changes we want. We were both very productive in contributing to the project - we took turns updating the project log and coding, and communicating to each other about new ideas or finding ways to implement the code. This experience 
                of taking turns and helping each other when help was needed enabled me to think different ways, take risks, learn new things from each other, and understand coding better. I also found my strengths in communicating, such as talking clearly and on topic. Because of our efficiency, we were able to finish the project ahead of time, and used the remaining days left of the project to make changes and edits. When it came to the gallery walk - where the class takes turns walking around to visit and comment on other students' projects,  we recieved lots of good feedback, such as how everything in our game was functional, 
                such as the score and timer, as well our game being interactive and competitive.
